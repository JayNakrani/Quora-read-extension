Quora Reader Extension
======================
A small utility extension for chrome to make reading easier on Quora Pages.
With the new interface of Quora it's annoying for some of its readers to read the actual content. As a solution to it, this extension was developed. It's only for personal use. 

It toggles between Reading Mode and Normal mode. Basically it hides the left & right columns and increases the width of the center column which has the reading content.
